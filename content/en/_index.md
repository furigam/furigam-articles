# Welcome (^ -^)

My name is Harper, I’m an overly nerdy game development student, musician and the only and current owner/writer of Furigam!

Furigam mainly exists so I can have a place to share my messy ideas with anyone that’s interested for some reason.

I hope you enjoy Furigam as I do ヾ(＠^∇^＠)ノ
